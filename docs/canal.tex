\chapter{Overview}

For a sufficiently complex software system, its maintainability and
extensibility is limited by our ability to understand and correctly
approximate the behaviour of the system, trace the impact of system
parts to each other, control the impact of modifications, ensure
correctness of the critical parts, and fixing bugs before they cause
serious consequences in production.

The maintainability and extensibility is affected by the programming
language of implementation.  Efficient low-level languages such as C
and C++ increase the complexity of the system by being closely aligned
with hardware. Systems must handle memory management, operate with
machine-dependent integers and floating point numbers, and use system
calls with complex invariants and interdependencies.

Canal is a framework combining existing static analysis techniques
improving maintainability, understanding, traceability and correctness
in a coherent manner.  The purpose of the framework is to make
existing techniques accessible and evaluable, and to support the
implementation of new techniques and allowing high quality
experiments.  Currently, techniques are often presented without proper
experiments on real-world complex systems, or just with a proprietary
implementation that cannot be investigated, so actual applicability
and impact of many techniques is unknown.  We hope to change this
situation.

The implementation can be used for a static analysis of real-world
complex software systems written in efficient low-level languages such
as C and C++.

\section{Use cases}
\subsection{Analysis of program behaviour}
You can hook on the fixpoint of function calls to inspect the
calculated abstract values.  You can get abstract values of function
call parameters.

\subsection{Comparison with a specification}
A set of pre- and post-conditions for functions, and variable-based or
module-based automata.  This can be defined for certain function or
library, and library/function users are watched to conform to the
specification.

\subsection{Conformance to environment constraints}
Double free, memory leaks, buffer overflow and underflow, division by
zero, invalid access to memory, locking and concurrency errors,
uncaught exceptions.

\part{Concepts}

\chapter{Preliminaries}

Definitions from the order theory.  More details can be found in
\cite{DP02}.

A binary relation $\sqsubseteq$ is \emph{reflexive} on a set
$\mathcal{D}$ if every element is related to itself: $a \sqsubseteq a$
for all $a \in \mathcal{D}$.  A binary relation $\sqsubseteq$ is
\emph{antisymmetric} on a set $\mathcal{D}$ if the following
implication holds: $a \sqsubseteq b$ and $b \sqsubseteq a$ implies $a
= b$.  A binary relation $\sqsubseteq$ is \emph{transitive} on a set
$\mathcal{D}$ if whenever an element $a$ is related to an element $b$,
and $b$ is in turn related to an element $c$, then $a$ is also related
to $c$: $a \sqsubseteq b$ and $b \sqsubseteq c$ implies $a \sqsubseteq
c$.

A \emph{partial order} $\sqsubseteq$ is a binary relation on a set
$\mathcal{D}$ which is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.  A
\emph{partial ordered set} or \emph{poset} for short is an ordered
pair $(\mathcal{D}, \sqsubseteq)$ of a set $\mathcal{D}$ together with
a partial ordering $\sqsubseteq$.

An element $a$ in a poset $(\mathcal{D}, \sqsubseteq)$ is called
\emph{maximal} if it is not less than any other element in
$\mathcal{D}$: $\nexists b \in \mathcal{D}, a \sqsubset b$.  If there
is an unique maximal element, we call it the \emph{greatest element}
and denote it by $\top$.  Similarly, an element $a$ in a poset
$(\mathcal{D}, \sqsubseteq)$ is called \emph{minimal} if it is not
greater than any other element in $\mathcal{D}$: $\nexists b \in
\mathcal{D}, b \sqsubset a$.  If there is an unique minimal element,
we call it the \emph{least element} and denote it by $\bot$.

Let $(\mathcal{D}, \sqsubseteq)$ be a poset and $A \subseteq
\mathcal{D}$.  An element $u \in \mathcal{D}$ is an \emph{upper bound}
of $A$ if $a \sqsubseteq u$ for all elements $a \in A$. The
\emph{least upper bound} or \emph{lub} for short is an element $x$
that is an upper bound on a subset $A$ and is less than all other
upper bounds on $A$; such an element is denoted by $\bigsqcup A$.
Similarly, an element $l \in \mathcal{D}$ is a \emph{lower bound} of
$A$ if $l \sqsubseteq a$ for all elements $a \in A$. The
\emph{greatest lower bound} or \emph{glb} for short is an element $x$
that is a lower bound on a subset $A$ and is greater than all other
lower bounds on $A$; such an element is denoted by $\bigsqcap A$.

A \emph{lattice} $(\mathcal{D}, \sqsubseteq, \sqcup, \sqcap)$ is a
partially ordered set in which any two elements $a, b \in \mathcal{D}$
have both a least upper bound, denoted by $a \sqcup b$, and a greatest
lower bound, denoted by $a \sqcap b$.  A \emph{complete lattice}
$(\mathcal{D}, \sqsubseteq, \sqcup, \sqcap, \bot, \top)$ is a
partially ordered set in which every subset $A \subseteq \mathcal{D}$
has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound.

A \emph{fixpoint} of a function $F$ is an element $X$ such that $F(X)
= X$.

A function $F \in \mathcal{D}_1 \to \mathcal{D}_2$ between two posets
$(\mathcal{D}_1, \sqsubseteq_1)$ and $(\mathcal{D}_2, \sqsubseteq_2)$
is \emph{monotonic} if $X \sqsubseteq_1 Y \implies F(X) \sqsubseteq_2
F(Y)$.  A function $F \in \mathcal{D}_1 \to \mathcal{D}_2$ is
\emph{strict} if $F(\bot_1) = \bot_2$.  A function $F \in
\mathcal{D}_1 \to \mathcal{D}_2$ is \emph{continuous} if it preserves
the existing limits of increasing chains $(X_i)_{i \in I}$:
$F(\bigsqcup_1 \{ X_i \mid i \in I \}) = \bigsqcup_2 \{ F(X_i) \mid i
\in I \}$ whenever $\bigsqcup_1 \{ X_i \mid i \in I \}$ exists.


\chapter{LLVM}
LLVM was first presented in \cite{LA04}.

Formalized in \cite{ZNMZ12}.

\chapter{Abstract Interpretation}
Our abstract interpreter comes in four flavours:
\begin{description}
\item[Context-insensitive flow-insensitive] For every function in a
  program, the fixpoint is calculated with a single set of abstract
  values that encompasses all function calls.
\item[Context-insensitive flow-sensitive] For every function in a
  program, the fixpoint is calculated with a single set of abstract
  values that encompasses all function calls, but every possible path
  through the function is calculated separately.
\item[Context-sensitive flow-insensitive] The fixpoint is calculated
  with a set of abstract values specifically created for every
  function call.
\item[Context-sensitive flow-sensitive] The fixpoint is calculated
  with a set of abstract values specifically created for every
  possible path in a function call.  Path conditions are taken into
  account.
\end{description}

Abstract interpreter can be either operational or equation-based.  Our
interpreter is operational.

\subsection{Tuning}
The precision of abstract interpreter is greately tunable. Here are
the aspects to consider:
\begin{description}
\item[Interpreter flavour] Context-sensitivity and flow-sensitivity
  increase both precision and complexity.
\item[Widening and narrowing] Selection and parameters of widening and
  narrowing operators affect both precision and complexity.
\item[Relations in abstract domains] Type and number of relations in
  abstract domains affect both precision and complexity.
\item[Memory for abstract domains] Parameters of some abstract domains
  allow to trade memory for better precision.
\end{description}

Maximal precision of abstract interpreter is same as for symbolic
executor, but abstract interpreter is more tunable.

\subsection{Context sensitivity}
Context sensitivity is achieved by keeping a function call stack.
Every stack frame keeps the complete state of a function fixpoint
calculation (all local and global variables).  When a function call is
reached during the fixpoint computation and function call parameters
are already initialized, a new frame is placed on the top of stack and
the called function is interpreted with the provided parameters.

\subsection{Flow sensitivity}


\chapter{Abstractions}

\section{Multi threading}
Multi-threading abstraction for Abstract Interpretation appeared in
\cite{M11}.

\section{Memory}
Memory abstraction appeared in \cite{M06}.

Our memory abstraction for abstract interpretation recognizes four
kinds of memory:
\begin{description}
\item[Register-like stack memory] This is function-level memory that
  is released automatically when function returns.  We denote such a
  memory by LLVM-style names starting with the percent sign
  \texttt{\%}.  Memory either has a name (e.g. \texttt{\%result}) or a
  number is generated to serve as a name (e.g. \texttt{\%32} denotes
  thirty-second unnamed instruction call in a function).
\item[Stack memory allocated by \texttt{alloca}] This is also a
  function-level memory that is released automatically when function
  returns.  The difference to register-like stack memory is that this
  memory is accessed by LLVM exclusively via pointers.  We denote such
  a memory by names starting with \texttt{\%\^}.  Every piece of
  memory has a name corresponding to the place where the memory has
  been allocated (\texttt{alloca} has been called).  So if the memory
  has been allocated by an instruction call \texttt{\%ptr = alloca
    i32, align 4}, it can be denoted by \texttt{\%\^{}ptr}.
\item[Global variables] Global variables are module-wise and are valid
  for the whole program run.  We denote such a memory by LLVM-style
  names starting with \texttt{@}.
\item[Heap memory] Heap memory is also valid for the whole program
  run.  We denote such a memory by names starting by \texttt{@\^}.
  Every piece of memory has a name corresponding to the place where
  the memory has been allocated (\texttt{malloc} or similar function
  has been called).  Name of the function is also included in the
  place name, so if a function \texttt{createString} contains an
  instruction call \texttt{\%result = call i8* @malloc(i32 1)}, we can
  denote the memory allocated on this place by
  \texttt{@\^{}createString:result}.
\end{description}

As it can be seen from the style of memory denotation, every piece of
memory is associated with a place in the program.  This means all
operations affecting a memory block allocated at certain place forms a
single abstract value.  Context-sensite abstract interpretation helps
to increase the precision of this memory abstraction.

\section{Arrays}

\section{Structures}

\section{Integers}
Precise machine integer abstraction appeared in \cite{M12}.

\section{Floating-point numbers}
Precise machine floating-point abstraction appeared in \cite{M12}.

\section{Pointers}
Pointer can be casted to a number via the \texttt{ptrtoint}
instruction.  Usually, the resulting memory offset is used to achieve
pointer arithmetics that are not available via \texttt{getelementptr}
semantics.

\chapter{Wishlist}
\begin{description}
\item[Lazy model-checking abstract value] Allow to investigate just a
  single function, taking into account all possible parameter values
  and shapes (perhaps limited by a pre-condition).  Parameter values
  and shapes must be smartly provided depending on the boundary
  requirements of the checked code.  This allows a kind of model
  checking, and use of model checking algorithms and ideas.
\item[Widening operators] Implement widening operators for integers
  and other abstract domains as required.
\item[Narrowing operators] Implement narrowing operators for integers
  and other abstract domains as required.
\item[String abstractions] Implement abstract domains specific for C
  strings.
\item[Weakly relational numeric abstractions] Implement weakly
  relational integer and floating-point abstract domains.
\item[Basic block abstraction] Implement basic block summaries that
  speed-up the static analysis.
\item[Function abstraction] Implement function summaries that speed-up
  the static analysis.
\item[Parallelization] Make abstract interpreter to use multiple
  threads for fixpoint calculation on the right level.
\item[Concurrency check] Add support for checking of multi-threaded
  programs.
\end{description}
